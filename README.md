## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

* This script outputs your **Sui Address**, **Base64 Private Key**, and **Mnemonic Phrase**.
* **NEVER SHARE the Base64 Private Key OR the Mnemonic Phrase.** Anyone possessing *either* can steal your funds.
* **Mnemonic Phrase:** This is the standard method for backing up and recovering Sui wallets in applications like Sui Wallet, Suiet, etc. Protect this phrase above all else, preferably offline.
* **Base64 Private Key:** This represents the raw secret key. While less commonly used for direct import into wallets than the mnemonic, it provides full control and must be kept absolutely secret.
* **SECURE THE `sui_wallets_output.txt` FILE IMMEDIATELY.** Delete it after securely storing the Mnemonic (and optionally the Base64 key) offline or in an encrypted password manager. Be especially careful on shared systems or servers.
* **This tool is primarily for development, testing, or educational purposes.** Do **NOT** use wallets generated this way for storing significant value without understanding Sui key management and securing the credentials properly.
* **USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK.** No responsibility is assumed for lost funds.

## üîß Configuration (Optional)

Adjust constants in `index.js`:

* `BOX_WIDTH`: Modify the console output box width.
* `WALLET_FILE`: Change the output filename.
